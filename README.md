## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

Created a calculator to perform one operation at a time, created a list of calculations on the server able to be cleared from client side. Noticed self avoiding problems rather than solving them (for stretch goals at least).

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
